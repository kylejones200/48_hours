## Where to Stay

Downtown makes sense. Hotels near Michigan Avenue, Millennium Park, or the Loop put you close to the Art Institute, Shedd Aquarium, and the Museum of Science and Industry. From here, everything sits within a walk or quick ride.

## Day 1: Art, Architecture, and Food

Start the morning at the **Art Institute of Chicago**. The collection spans centuries—from ancient works to American icons like Hopper’s *Nighthawks*. Step outside into **Millennium Park** to see the Bean reflect the skyline.

In the afternoon, join an **Architecture Boat Tour** on the Chicago River. Guides explain the skyline’s history, and you see the city shift as bridges rise and towers line the water.

Dinner means **The Purple Pig** on Michigan Avenue. Mediterranean small plates, house-made charcuterie, and bold wines define the meal. Afterward, find the **Aviary**, Grant Achatz’s bar where cocktails arrive as theater. Drinks come in glass globes, smoke rises, and the staff treats every order like performance art.

## Day 2: Science and the Lake

Start early at the **Museum of Science and Industry**. Its scale is massive—submarines, trains, flight simulators, and interactive exhibits. It feels like a city inside a museum.

In the afternoon, walk along the lakefront to the **Shedd Aquarium**. Whale sharks do not swim here, but beluga whales, sea otters, and colorful reef tanks fill the space. The building itself, set on the water, frames Lake Michigan as part of the view.

Evening leaves time for another walk downtown, or a return to Millennium Park to see the city lights reflect in the Bean. Dinner can circle back to The Purple Pig or another spot along Michigan Avenue.

## Why 48 Hours Works

Chicago compresses well. You move from masterpieces in the Art Institute to starfish in the Shedd, from Purple Pig plates to Aviary cocktails, from Millennium Park to the river’s edge. In two days you get the city’s rhythm: food, art, and water tied by architecture.
