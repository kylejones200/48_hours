Austin runs on barbecue, live music, and cold spring water. In two days you can eat brisket, swim in Barton Springs, shop South Congress, and end nights under string lights with a band playing close by.

## Day 1 Evening: Arrival, Dinner, and Sixth Street

Stay at the Westin Austin Downtown, a block from Sixth Street. Rooms have tall windows and a rooftop pool with city views. For dinner, walk to Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill. Plates of Southern comfort food arrive in a space that feels warm and historic. Afterward, step into Sixth Street. Bars fill each block, bands play blues and rock, and the street itself turns into one long festival.

## Day 2 Morning: Barbecue and South Congress

Line up at Franklin Barbecue if you want the city’s best brisket, or cut the wait at Micklethwait or Cooper’s. The smoke and spice carry the meal. Afterward, spend the afternoon on South Congress. Murals brighten the walls, vintage shops spill onto sidewalks, and coffee houses keep the street alive.

## Day 2 Evening: Dinner and Music

Come back downtown for dinner. Eddie V’s serves steak and seafood, Fixe leans into Southern plates with polish. Both give you comfort with a bit of shine. When the meal ends, find music again. Sixth Street roars, but smaller bars nearby keep things softer. Either way, you end the night in Austin’s rhythm.

## Day 3 Morning: Springs and Parks

Start at Barton Springs Pool. The water stays cold year-round, clear enough to see the bottom. Grass lines the edge, perfect for drying off in the sun. From there, walk into Zilker Park or rent a kayak on Lady Bird Lake. Both keep you outside, both feel like Austin.

## Day 3 Afternoon: Lunch and Rainey Street

Lunch at Neighborhood Sushi feels light and modern. Then spend the afternoon on Rainey Street. Old houses turned into bars spill onto porches. Food trucks line the yards with tacos and sliders. String lights glow above, and music drifts across patios. It’s an easy end to the weekend before you head back downtown to check out.

## Why It Works for a Weekend

The Westin is a good base. Moonshine, Eddie V’s, Fixe, and Neighborhood Sushi cover the meals. Barton Springs and South Congress show the city by day. Sixth Street and Rainey Street keep it moving at night. In 48 hours you taste barbecue, swim cold water, and hear music that never stops.
