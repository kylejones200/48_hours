Austin runs on barbecue, live music, and spring water. In two days you can eat brisket, swim in Barton Springs, shop South Congress, and end your nights under string lights with a band playing nearby.

## Day 1 Evening: Arrival, Dinner, and Sixth Street

Check in at the **Westin Austin Downtown**, a short walk from Sixth Street. Rooms are modern with floor-to-ceiling windows, and the rooftop pool looks over the skyline. For dinner, step next door to **Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill**. Southern comfort food and cocktails land in a space that feels historic but casual. Afterward, head to Sixth Street. Bars pack the blocks, bands play everything from blues to rock, and the street itself feels like a festival.

## Day 2 Morning: Barbecue and South Congress

Start with brisket at **Franklin Barbecue** if you’re willing to line up, or skip the wait at **Micklethwait** or **Cooper’s**. After lunch, wander South Congress. Murals, vintage shops, and coffee houses line the strip, making it the city’s best street for an afternoon walk.

## Day 2 Evening: Fine Dining and Live Music

Return downtown for dinner. Choose **Eddie V’s** for steak and seafood or **Fixe** for updated Southern dishes. Both balance polish with comfort. Afterward, dive back into Sixth Street or find a smaller bar with acoustic sets. Music pours into the night, and you end the day in Austin’s rhythm.

## Day 3 Morning: Springs and Parks

Spend the morning at **Barton Springs Pool**. The water is cold, clear, and ringed with grass for lounging. Walk **Zilker Park** afterward, or rent a kayak on Lady Bird Lake for time on the water.

## Day 3 Afternoon: Lunch and Rainey Street

Stop at **Neighborhood Sushi** for a bright, modern lunch. Then head to **Rainey Street**, where old houses turned into bars fill with people. Food trucks serve tacos and sliders, string lights hang across patios, and live music drifts from porches. It’s a laid-back close to the weekend before heading back downtown to check out.

## Why It Works for a Weekend

The Westin anchors the stay. Moonshine, Eddie V’s, Fixe, and Neighborhood Sushi shape the meals. Barton Springs and South Congress show Austin by day. Sixth Street and Rainey Street carry it by night. In 48 hours you get Austin’s balance: smoky food, cold water, and music that never quits.
