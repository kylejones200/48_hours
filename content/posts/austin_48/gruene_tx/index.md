Texas Hill Country lives easy. You float the Guadalupe River in the afternoon, then spend the night in Gruene with live music and a cold drink.



## Float the Guadalupe River

The Guadalupe winds through cypress trees and limestone banks. In summer it turns into a long, lazy ride. You rent a tube from one of the local outfitters, tie coolers together, and drift for hours. The water is cold and clear. Music drifts across the current from other groups. You bump into rocks and laugh as the river takes you. It is part picnic, part adventure, part Texas tradition.



## Gruene Hall

After the river you head into Gruene. Gruene Hall calls itself the oldest dance hall in Texas. The wooden floor creaks, the stage glows, and bands play country, blues, and rock. Musicians from Willie Nelson to George Strait have played here. The crowd dances, drinks, and leans against the walls under ceiling fans that turn slow in the heat.



## Mozie’s Bar

Across the street sits Mozie’s. It mixes small-town bar feel with a modern menu. You grab a burger, order a cocktail, and sit down to cool off. Locals mingle with travelers, and the night stretches late.



## Closing

The Guadalupe and Gruene pair together. You float the river by day, then hear music and sip a drink by night. Few places match that rhythm of water, wood floors, and good company.
