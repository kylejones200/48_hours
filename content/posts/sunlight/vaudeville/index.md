The Glenwood Vaudeville Revue is dinner and a show. It sits in the middle of Glenwood Springs, easy to reach after a day on the slopes or in the hot springs.

**The Experience**
The theater feels old-timey and lighthearted. You sit at long tables, order food and drinks, and the performers step on stage for comedy, skits, and live music. The humor is fast, the songs are lively, and the actors play straight to the audience. Crowds clap along and laugh together. The energy makes it feel more like a community gathering than a polished production.

**Why It Works**
This revue fits the town. Glenwood Springs is unpretentious, quirky, and friendly. The show has the same tone. It’s a place where families, couples, and groups of friends relax and laugh after a day outdoors.

**Practical Info**
Shows run seasonally, often on weekends, with rotating acts. Tickets include the show; food and drinks are extra. You can reserve online or at the door if seats are open.

**Closing**
The Glenwood Vaudeville Revue keeps live theater light and fun. It’s the perfect counterbalance to mountain days and hot spring nights.
