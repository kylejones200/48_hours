Doc Holliday came to Glenwood Springs to treat his tuberculosis. He died here in 1887. Today his story lives in a small museum under a clothing store on Grand Avenue.

**The Experience**
The museum sits down a narrow set of stairs in the shop’s basement. It holds photos, personal items, and displays about the gunslinger’s life. Cases show his ties to Wyatt Earp, the OK Corral, and the end of the frontier era. Visitors stand close to the exhibits, as if paging through someone’s personal archive.

**Why It Works**
The setting makes it unique. You find a bit of Old West lore hidden below a modern store. It feels less like a tourist stop and more like a secret worth sharing.

**Practical Info**
The museum charges a small entry fee. It takes less than an hour to walk through, making it an easy stop while exploring downtown Glenwood. The nearby Linwood Cemetery, where Holliday is buried, offers a follow-up visit for those who want the full story.

**Closing**
The Doc Holliday Collection is small, tucked away, and unforgettable. It grounds Glenwood Springs in the grit of western history.
