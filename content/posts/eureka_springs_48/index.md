Eureka Springs feels tucked into the Ozark hills, with winding streets, Victorian houses, and shops that climb up steep roads. In two days you can stay in a hillside Airbnb, ride an old train, wander quirky stores, and visit a house made of stone and glass unlike any other.

## Where to Stay

Book an **Airbnb** close to the historic district. Many cottages and cabins sit on the hillsides, with porches that look out over the trees. Staying local keeps you within walking distance of shops and restaurants while giving you a retreat at night.


## Day 1: The Haunted Hotel and the Train

Start with the **Crescent Hotel**, often called “America’s Most Haunted Hotel.” Built in 1886 as a resort for the wealthy, it later became a hospital and sanatorium. Today it runs ghost tours at night, telling stories of strange figures, tragic patients, and lingering spirits. The building itself, with stone walls and wide verandas, feels like a relic of another age.

In the afternoon, ride the **Eureka Springs & North Arkansas Railway**. Vintage locomotives and passenger cars take you through Ozark woods. The excursion is short, but the sound of the whistle and the slow roll of the cars make it feel like stepping back in time. Some trips serve meals, while others focus on the scenery.

Dinner can be downtown, where small restaurants line the narrow streets. Afterward, return to your Airbnb and enjoy the quiet hills.

## Day 2: Shops and Quigley’s Castle

Spend the morning walking through **Eureka Springs’ shops**. Streets wind and curve, with storefronts stacked on terraces. Antique stores, art galleries, and oddities fill the district. The walk itself is part of the charm—you climb steps, duck into alleys, and find surprises around corners.

In the afternoon, visit **Quigley’s Castle: The Ozarks’ Strangest Dwelling**. Built in 1943 by Elise Quigley, the house has walls covered with stones and fossils she collected. Inside, tropical plants grow in beds built into the floor, reaching toward the high ceiling. The garden outside is filled with bottle trees, shells, and found objects. It feels less like a house and more like a living work of folk art.

## Why 48 Hours Works

Eureka Springs offers a mix of history, folklore, and oddity. You stay in a hillside Airbnb, hear ghost stories in the Crescent Hotel, ride a vintage train, and walk winding streets full of shops. Quigley’s Castle closes the trip with a house unlike any other. Two days show you why Eureka Springs feels both timeless and strange.
