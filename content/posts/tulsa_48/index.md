Tulsa pairs oil-boom history with family parks, hearty food, and coffee roasted downtown. In two days you can stay in a boutique hotel, wander stacks of books, eat pizza and comfort food, and watch kids play in a world-class park.

## Friday Evening – Arrival and Dinner at The Brook

Check in at the **Ambassador Hotel**. Built in 1929 for oil executives, it holds art deco charm with modern comfort. After dropping bags, head to **The Brook** for dinner. The menu leans into comfort—burgers, fried chicken, sandwiches, and big portions. It sets a local tone: casual, filling, and easygoing.

## Saturday Morning – Coffee and Books

Start at **Topeca Coffee Roasters**. Beans are roasted in-house, and the café hums with locals on laptops and friends talking across small tables. Order a pour-over or cappuccino and take it slow.

From there, head to **Gardner’s Used Books & Music**. The warehouse stretches with aisles of novels, history, science fiction, and rare finds. Another wing holds records, CDs, and comics. It feels endless, and each aisle turns into a hunt for something unexpected.

## Saturday Afternoon – Gathering Place

Spend the afternoon at **Gathering Place**, Tulsa’s 66-acre park along the Arkansas River. Kids run across climbing towers, slides, and rope structures while adults explore gardens and walking paths. Lakes and boathouses add a quiet side. It feels like a civic gift, free and sprawling, with enough to fill an entire day.

## Saturday Evening – Pizza at Andolini’s

For dinner, grab a table at **Andolini’s Pizza**. The New York–style pies come with chewy crusts, inventive toppings, and slices you fold in half. Families and groups fill the space, and the menu’s variety means everyone finds something. Afterward, return to the Ambassador for a nightcap or a walk through downtown’s lit streets.

## Sunday Morning – Coffee and the Discovery Lab

Begin with another cup from **Topeca Coffee**, then take the family to the **Discovery Lab**, Tulsa’s kids’ museum near Gathering Place. Hands-on science exhibits, tunnels, and climbing structures keep children busy, while art and building stations give them room to create.

## Sunday Afternoon – Wrap Up at the Ambassador

Return to the Ambassador for check-out. The quiet lobby and boutique scale close the weekend on a calm note. You leave with the sense of Tulsa as both historic and playful—where oil-boom towers meet pizza shops, and a grand hotel weekend balances with time in a park.
