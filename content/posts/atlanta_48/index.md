Atlanta rewards a short visit. In two days you can taste barbecue, watch whale sharks glide past, stand on Olympic grounds, and stay in a hotel at the center of it all.

## Where to Stay
Book a room at the Glenn Hotel downtown. Drop your bags and step outside. The lobby glows with warm light and modern art, and a rooftop bar waits above. From there, walk to Brother’s BBQ. Order ribs or brisket with greens and mac and cheese. The smoke hits first, then the spice, and the meal feels like a welcome. After dinner, wander the streets near the hotel. Downtown glitters at night, full of noise and light.

**Brother’s BBQ**
Brother’s BBQ feels like a local hangout. The menu is simple—ribs, brisket, pulled pork. The meat is tender and smoky, the sides hearty. The place has an easy rhythm that makes you stay longer than planned.

**Georgia Aquarium**
The Georgia Aquarium ranks among the largest in the world. Whale sharks circle in a massive tank. Rays pass overhead in glass tunnels. Families crowd into dolphin and sea lion shows. The scale of the place makes it less a stop and more a half-day journey.

**Centennial Olympic Park**
Centennial Olympic Park keeps the memory of 1996 alive. Its fountains leap in time with music. Wide lawns stretch across 22 acres, framed by downtown towers. Kids run through splash pads, couples stroll, and summer events fill the open space. It’s part history, part everyday park.

**The Glenn Hotel**
The Glenn Hotel gives you a base close to everything. Rooms are clean and bright, the lobby warm with light and art. From the rooftop bar you look across the city. Walk out the front door and you reach the aquarium and Olympic Park within minutes.

## Day 2: Aquarium and Olympic Park

Wake up near the action. Walk to the Georgia Aquarium and spend the morning. Watch whale sharks drift past, rays sweep overhead, and crowds cheer at the shows. By afternoon, head into Olympic Park. Sit near the fountains, stretch out on the grass, and watch the city move around you. End the night back at the Glenn rooftop, where the skyline shifts from gold to dark blue.

## Day 3: Slow Morning and Departure

Start easy. Grab coffee nearby or a quick breakfast. If the weather holds, circle back through Olympic Park. By midday it’s time to check out. You leave with the sense that Atlanta gives plenty in a short time.

## Why 48 Hours Works

Atlanta is compact and full. Food, history, and spectacle all sit close downtown. Two days give you enough to feel the city and enough reason to come back.
