Atlanta rewards a short visit. In two days you can taste barbecue, watch whale sharks glide past, stand on Olympic grounds, and stay in a hotel at the center of it all.

## Where to Stay
Book a room at the Glenn Hotel downtown. Drop your bags and step outside. The lobby glows with warm light and modern art, and a rooftop bar waits above. From there, walk to Brother’s BBQ. Order ribs or brisket with greens and mac and cheese. The smoke hits first, then the spice, and the meal feels like a welcome. After dinner, wander the streets near the hotel. Downtown glitters at night, full of noise and light.

**Brother’s BBQ**
Brother’s BBQ feels like a local hangout. The menu is simple—ribs, brisket, pulled pork. The meat is tender and smoky, the sides hearty. The place has an easy rhythm that makes you stay longer than planned.

**Georgia Aquarium**

### Breakfast
Start your day at West Egg Cafe for Southern breakfast classics.

### Lunch  
Head to Brother's BBQ for authentic Georgia barbecue.

### Dinner
End the day at The Optimist for fresh seafood in a lively atmosphere.

## Day 2

### Morning
Visit the Georgia Aquarium to see whale sharks and beluga whales.

### Afternoon
Walk through Centennial Olympic Park and visit the nearby World of Coca-Cola.

### Evening
Explore the Atlanta BeltLine for dinner and drinks at Ponce City Market.

## Day 3: Slow Morning and Departure

Start easy. Grab coffee nearby or a quick breakfast. If the weather holds, circle back through Olympic Park. By midday it’s time to check out. You leave with the sense that Atlanta gives plenty in a short time.

## Why 48 Hours Works

Atlanta is compact and full. Food, history, and spectacle all sit close downtown. Two days give you enough to feel the city and enough reason to come back.
