Oklahoma City mixes modern energy with deep history. In two days you can stay in a historic landmark hotel and see the city’s biggest events in a state-of-the-art arena.

## Where to Stay: The National Hotel

The National Hotel stands inside a former First National Bank skyscraper. The building dates to 1931, and its Art Deco design dominates downtown with carved stone, murals, and brass fixtures. The restoration turned the bank’s grand lobby into a soaring space filled with marble, gold leaf, and murals overhead. Walking into the hotel feels like stepping into the height of the oil boom.

Rooms keep the Art Deco feel but layer in modern design. The lobby bar and restaurants serve craft cocktails and upscale takes on regional food. You can stay here and feel both the history of Oklahoma City and the pace of its revival.



## Paycom Center

A short walk away sits the **Paycom Center**, home to the Oklahoma City Thunder. The arena holds over 18,000 fans, and on game nights the energy surges through downtown. The noise swells, the crowd roars, and the team anchors civic pride. Beyond basketball, the Paycom Center hosts major concerts and touring shows, so you might see NBA action one night and live music the next.

Inside, wide concourses circle the floor, with Oklahoma food stands and plenty of seating. Outside, the arena lights up with banners and fans streaming in. If the National Hotel shows the city’s history, the Paycom Center shows its pulse right now.

## Why 48 Hours Works

Stay in the National Hotel, eat and drink in its restored bank lobby, then walk to the Paycom Center for a game or concert. That mix of historic glamour and modern energy captures Oklahoma City’s identity. Two days give you both: past and present tied by a short walk downtown.
