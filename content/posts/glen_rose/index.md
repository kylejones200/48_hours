Glen Rose calls itself the "Dinosaur Capital of Texas," and for good reason. Prehistoric tracks fill the riverbeds, life-sized dinosaur statues guard a roadside park, and a wildlife safari sprawls across the hills. Add in small-town charm, big limestone rocks, and local museums, and you have a weekend that's both adventurous and easygoing.

## Where to Stay  
Base yourself at a local Airbnb or inn near the square. Our stay at **Live Oak BnB** put us within easy reach of parks, museums, and restaurants, while giving us a quiet space to recharge after busy days outdoors.  


## Day One: Tracks and Trails  
Begin with breakfast at your rental before heading to **Dinosaur Valley State Park**. Spend the morning hiking riverside trails and searching for real dinosaur tracks pressed into the limestone riverbed. Kids can wade, swim, and marvel at the fossilized footprints. Bring a picnic for lunch under the oaks.  

In the afternoon, relax back at your lodging or stroll the historic town square. For dinner, try one of the casual spots around Glen Rose, where barbecue and Tex-Mex dominate the menus.  



## Day Two: Wildlife and Small-Town Finds  
Start with mass at **St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church** if you’re visiting on a Sunday. Then head to **Dinosaur World**, a roadside park filled with hundreds of life-sized dinosaur models, a fossil dig, and a playground. It’s a hit with kids and an easy stop near the state park.  

After lunch, drive to **Fossil Rim Wildlife Center**, a drive-through safari where giraffes, zebras, antelope, and rhinos roam free. Rolling hills and wide views make it one of the best wildlife parks in Texas.  

Round out the afternoon at **Big Rocks Park**, a downtown riverside spot where giant limestone boulders sit in shallow water. It’s free, fun, and perfect for climbing, wading, and relaxing before heading home.  



## Other Stops  
If time allows, explore the **Creation Evidence Museum**, the **Somervell County Museum**, or browse antique shops downtown. Each offers a window into local history and culture.  



## Closing  
Two days in Glen Rose blend dinosaurs, safaris, and small-town Texas charm. Families leave with muddy shoes, a phone full of photos, and a sense of stepping both back in time and out into nature.
