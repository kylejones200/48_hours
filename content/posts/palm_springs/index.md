## Day 1: Arrival and the Aerial Tramway

Arrive in Palm Springs and check into your hotel or rental. The desert heat is sharp, so start with the **Palm Springs Aerial Tramway**. The rotating tramcar climbs 8,500 feet up Mount San Jacinto. At the top, the air cools, and views stretch across the Coachella Valley. Trails loop through pine forest, and picnic areas give space to relax.

In the late afternoon, return to town and cool off at a **kid-friendly pool or water park**. Many Palm Springs resorts keep large family pools with slides and shallow areas, and public splash pads give quick relief.



## Day 2: Hands-On Museums and the Living Desert

Begin at the **Children’s Discovery Museum of the Desert**. Kids can build, climb, and experiment through dozens of interactive exhibits. It’s designed for play and learning in equal measure.

After lunch, head to the **Living Desert Zoo and Gardens**. The grounds stretch across 80 acres, with desert plants and animals from Africa and North America. Giraffes, cheetahs, and camels mix with cactus gardens and shaded paths. Families often stay for the animal feedings and keeper talks.

Evening can mean a **bike ride or short hike** along one of Palm Springs’ many trails. Family-friendly paths near town let you see desert scenery without long climbs.



## Day 3: Discovery and Aviation History

Spend the morning at leisure—many families enjoy a slow breakfast and a swim. In the afternoon, visit the **Palm Springs Air Museum**. Vintage aircraft fill the hangars, from World War II fighters to Cold War jets. Exhibits let kids climb into cockpits and talk with volunteer pilots. It’s hands-on and close-up, making history tangible.



## Day 4: Day Trip to Joshua Tree

Drive less than an hour to **Joshua Tree National Park**. The landscape is otherworldly: giant boulders, spiky Joshua trees, and wide desert views. Families can explore short hikes like Hidden Valley or Skull Rock, climb gentle rock formations, and stop at picnic sites. Bring water, hats, and sunscreen—the desert is dry even in cooler months.

Return to Palm Springs in the evening with a sense of space that few places match.



## Closing

Palm Springs works with kids because it blends play, discovery, and nature. You ride into cool mountain air, wander through museums, see animals and planes, and spend a day among desert rocks. Four days give you a full circle of fun and exploration.
