Washington, DC is a city of museums, monuments, and green spaces built around the National Mall. With so many free Smithsonian museums and kid-friendly stops, two days can be full without costing much. Families will find hands-on exhibits, animals, and iconic landmarks at every turn.  



## Where to Stay  
Choose a hotel or Airbnb near the National Mall or a Metro stop. Central locations make it easy to walk to museums or hop on the Metro to reach the zoo and neighborhoods.  



## Day One: The Mall and Museums  

Start at the **National Museum of Natural History**. See the Hope Diamond, a giant squid, and taxidermy halls. Kids love the Butterfly Pavilion (free on Tuesdays) and the tarantula feedings.  

Walk next door to the **National Museum of American History**, where you’ll find the Star-Spangled Banner, presidential artifacts, and family-friendly spaces like the Spark!Lab inventors’ workshop and Wegmans Wonderplace for younger children.  

After lunch (pack one for the Kogod Courtyard inside the National Gallery of Art), stop at the **National Air and Space Museum**. Rockets, Apollo 11, and flight simulators bring space travel and aviation to life.  

If time allows, cross to the **National Gallery of Art**. While known for its masterpieces, it also offers family guides and storytelling in the galleries.  

Finish your day on the Mall with a stop at the **US Botanic Garden**, where kids can dig in the Children’s Garden or follow scavenger hunts among tropical plants.  



## Day Two: Animals, Spies, and Neighborhoods  

Begin with a trip to the **National Zoo** in Woodley Park. Admission is free, and the highlight is the giant pandas. Stroll through Asia Trail and Amazonia before lunch nearby.  

In the afternoon, take Metro back toward downtown. The **International Spy Museum** is one of the few paid attractions but worth it. Kids take on secret identities and complete missions while adults learn Cold War stories and tech history.  

End the day with smaller, fun stops:  
- **National Museum of the American Indian** – explore Native cultures and try the hands-on ImagiNations Activity Center.  
- **National Postal Museum** near Union Station – make your own stamp and explore mail trains.  
- **White House Visitor Center** – interactive exhibits on the presidency, only a short walk from the Mall.  



## Other Options  
The **National Geographic Museum**, **National Building Museum**, and neighborhood walks (Georgetown, Capitol Hill) give more variety if you extend your stay.  



## Closing  
Washington, DC offers two full days of history, art, and adventure, much of it free. Kids come away having seen dinosaurs, pandas, rockets, and monuments, while parents enjoy a capital city filled with culture.
