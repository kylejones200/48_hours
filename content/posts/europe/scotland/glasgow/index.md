Glasgow has grit, warmth, and an edge. Once an industrial hub, it now thrives on music, design, and nightlife. A weekend gives you a taste of its art, history, and friendly energy.



## Where to Stay

Stay near George Square if you want central access to shopping and transport. The West End offers leafy streets, university buildings, and café culture. Merchant City blends old warehouses with stylish bars and lofts.



## Day 1: City and Style

Start in George Square, the city’s heart. Walk to Buchanan Street, Glasgow’s shopping mile with street performers and Victorian arcades. Visit the Gallery of Modern Art, set in a neoclassical building topped by the Duke of Wellington statue with its trademark traffic cone.

In the afternoon, head west to Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. Its collection ranges from Salvador Dalí to medieval arms. Nearby, stroll through Kelvingrove Park and the University of Glasgow, whose cloisters inspired Hogwarts.

At night, sample Glasgow’s music scene. King Tut’s Wah Wah Hut is legendary, or you can catch gigs at the Barrowlands Ballroom.



## Day 2: Industrial Past and Creative Present

Take the Riverside Museum, designed by Zaha Hadid, where trains, trams, and cars trace Glasgow’s industrial history. Step outside to see the tall ship Glenlee moored on the Clyde.

Explore Merchant City’s bars, shops, and cafés. For design fans, visit The Lighthouse, Scotland’s center for architecture and design, with a tower view across the city.

In the evening, dive into Glasgow’s food culture. Try modern Scottish dishes in Finnieston, the city’s dining hotspot, then finish with a whisky at a snug pub.



## Closing

Glasgow mixes tradition with reinvention. The city wears its history openly but thrives on creativity, music, and conversation. Two days reveal its rough edges and its charm.
