Scotland balances history, castles, museums, and rugged landscapes. This 10-day trip begins in Edinburgh, continues with day trips into the Highlands, and closes in Glasgow. Along the way you tour royal palaces, walk the Royal Mile, and see both art and aviation.



## Days 1–5: Edinburgh

**Arrival and Stay**
Check into your Airbnb on St. Leonard’s Hill in Edinburgh for four nights. The location keeps you close to the Royal Mile and within walking distance of major sites.

**Day 1 – Castle and Royal Mile**
Begin with a guided castle tour, an Airbnb Experience led by Ben. Edinburgh Castle sits on volcanic rock above the city. The Crown Jewels and the Stone of Destiny fill its vaults, and the One O’Clock Gun still fires daily. After the castle, walk the Royal Mile. Stop at **St. Giles’ Cathedral** with its crown spire, then continue to the **Palace of Holyroodhouse**, the royal residence at the far end of the Mile. If the palace is closed for royal visits, tour the Scottish Parliament instead.

**Day 2 – The Royal Mile in Depth**
Return to the Royal Mile with an audio tour. Walk past the Tartan Weaving Mill, Camera Obscura, and The Hub. Explore Gladstone’s Land, a 400-year-old tenement, and the Writers’ Museum, dedicated to Burns, Scott, and Stevenson. Stop at Grassmarket Square for food and Victoria Street for photographs. Visit **St. Giles Cathedral** again for more detail. End the day with a pint and live folk music at Whiski or The Mitre.

**Day 3 – Museums and Spirit of Scotland Show**
Visit the **National Museum of Scotland**. The Treasures Exhibit mixes natural history, artifacts, and design. The building’s grand atrium gives scale to the experience. In the evening, attend the **Spirit of Scotland Show** at the Royal College of Surgeons. Music, dance, and storytelling give a cultural close to the day.

**Day 4 – Holyroodhouse and Leisure**
Tour the **Palace of Holyroodhouse** if open. Built in the 1100s and tied to legends of St. Margaret, it combines monastery ruins with royal apartments. Spend the afternoon wandering shops on Cockburn Street or sitting in Parliament Square.

**Day 5 – Day Trips from Edinburgh**
Consider a short trip to **Stirling Castle**, less than an hour away. The castle’s halls show the power of Scottish kings, and the town below carries its medieval layout. Alternatives include Tantallon Castle or Dean Castle for ruins and countryside.



## Days 6–9: Glasgow

**Day 6 – Arrival in Glasgow**
Drive or take the train to Glasgow and check into the **Moxy Hotel, Merchant City**. Begin with a 1.5-hour hop-on/off bus ride for an overview. Stops include the Cathedral Precinct, Riverside Museum, and Kelvingrove Museum.

**Day 7 – Hunterian Museum and West End**
Tour the **Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery** at the University of Glasgow. See Antonine Wall artifacts, fossils, and cabinets of curiosities. The **Mackintosh House** recreates the home of Charles Rennie Mackintosh, filled with curved lines and proto-Art Deco style. The art gallery holds work from the Glasgow Boys, Scottish Colourists, and a strong James Whistler collection.

**Day 8 – Kelvingrove and Riverside**
Spend the day at the **Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum**, known for its range from natural history to fine art. Then head to the **Riverside Museum**, a modern transport museum with trams, cars, and locomotives. The nearby Tall Ship adds a maritime note.

**Day 9 – Leisure in Glasgow**
Walk the West End’s streets, filled with cafés and shops. Visit the Cathedral or take a second bus loop to cover ground you missed earlier.



## Day 10 – Departure

Check out of the Moxy Hotel. Catch your flight from Edinburgh to Chicago. The trip closes with layers of memory: castles and cathedrals, ghost tours and folk pubs, Mackintosh curves and Roman walls.



## Why This Trip Works

Scotland rewards both depth and variety. Edinburgh shows medieval stone, royal ceremony, and cultural rhythm. Stirling and castles nearby add history. Glasgow layers art, design, and museums. Day trips stretch into countryside and coast. Ten days give you the scale to see the country’s cities, castles, and culture in balance.
