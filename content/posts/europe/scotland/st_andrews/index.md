St Andrews is more than golf. The medieval streets, sea views, and university traditions shape a town that feels both historic and alive. Two days here balance history, coastal walks, and the slow pace of a seaside town.



## Where to Stay

Small hotels and guesthouses cluster near the Old Course and the town center. Staying near North Street or South Street keeps you close to the cathedral ruins, the castle, and the university. Many inns also offer views of the sea.



## Day 1: History and Sea Air

Start at the ruins of St Andrews Cathedral. The scale shows how central the town once was to Scottish religious life. Climb St Rule’s Tower for a view across the Fife coast.

Walk to St Andrews Castle. The cliffside ruins and underground mine tunnels reveal stories of siege and reformation. Afterward, follow the Fife Coastal Path south for sea air and views back to the town.

Dinner works best in a traditional pub. Local fish, venison, or game pie pairs well with a dram of whisky.



## Day 2: Golf and University Life

Begin at the Old Course. Even if you do not play, the Swilcan Bridge and Royal & Ancient Clubhouse mark one of golf’s most famous sights. The British Golf Museum across the road gives context to the sport’s history.

Wander the University of St Andrews. Its quadrangles and courtyards date back to the 15th century. Students’ traditions—like the red gowns and May Dip—still shape the atmosphere.

End your trip with a walk along West Sands Beach. The wide strand made famous in *Chariots of Fire* offers space to reflect before leaving.


**R\&A World Golf Museum (St Andrews, Scotland)**
Across from the Old Course, this museum charts golf’s story from medieval pastime to global sport. Clubs, balls, and old scorecards tell the tale. Fans will enjoy the multimedia exhibits that bring great tournaments to life. Even non-golfers will appreciate the town’s deep ties to the game.

*Practical info:* Open daily 10–5. Adults £12. Easy walk from central St Andrews bus station. Website: [randa.org/world-golf-museum](https://www.randa.org/world-golf-museum).
