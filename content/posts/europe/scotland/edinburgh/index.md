Edinburgh blends medieval history with modern culture. A weekend gives you enough time to explore the castle, walk the Royal Mile, taste whisky, and see the city from Arthur’s Seat. The compact size means you can fit a lot into two days without feeling rushed.



## Where to Stay

Stay in Old Town if you want to walk to most sites. Hotels near the Royal Mile put you close to the castle, Holyrood, and St Giles’ Cathedral. Grassmarket has boutique hotels with views of the castle. For a quieter base, choose New Town, where Georgian townhouses line elegant streets.



## Day 1: Castle, Mile, and Whisky

Start at **Edinburgh Castle**, perched on its volcanic rock. Tour the Crown Jewels, the Great Hall, and the views across the city. Walk down the **Royal Mile**, stopping at St Giles’ Cathedral and closes that hide courtyards and taverns. For lunch, try traditional haggis or a Scotch pie at a pub.

In the afternoon, explore the **National Museum of Scotland**, which mixes Scottish history with interactive exhibits. As evening falls, join a **whisky tasting** at The Scotch Whisky Experience or a small whisky bar in Old Town. End the night in Grassmarket, where pubs buzz with live music.



## Day 2: Climb, Art, and Ghosts

Begin with a walk up **Arthur’s Seat**, the extinct volcano that gives sweeping views of the city and sea. It takes about an hour to climb, and the payoff is worth it. Afterward, visit the **Palace of Holyroodhouse**, the King’s official Scottish residence.

For lunch, head to New Town for modern Scottish fare. Spend the afternoon at the **Scottish National Gallery**, home to works by Botticelli, Rembrandt, and Scottish masters. In the evening, book a **ghost tour** that winds through underground vaults and graveyards, a thrilling way to close your visit.



## Conclusion

Two days in Edinburgh capture its essence. You see castles and cathedrals, taste whisky, hike an ancient volcano, and hear ghost stories that linger. The city’s size and walkability make it ideal for a weekend trip, leaving you with both memories and reasons to return.
