Luxembourg City sits high above rivers and valleys, a fortress that became a crossroads. Old walls meet EU towers. Two days here mix history, food, and quiet walks in a compact capital.

## Where to Stay

Stay near the Ville Haute, the old town, to walk everywhere. Boutique hotels line the cobbled streets. The Grund below offers quieter nights along the river with cafés close by.

## Day 1: Old Town and the Casemates

Start in the Place d’Armes, the city’s square ringed by cafés. Walk to the Grand Ducal Palace and watch the changing of the guard. Step inside Notre-Dame Cathedral to see its carved detail and stained glass.

In the afternoon, go underground into the Casemates du Bock, the vast tunnels cut into rock for centuries of defense. From the ramparts above, look out across the Pétrusse Valley and Alzette River.

Dinner means hearty Luxembourgish dishes: Judd mat Gaardebounen (smoked pork with beans) or Rieslingspaschtéit (pâté with Riesling wine). Pair with Moselle white wine.

## Day 2: Grund and Kirchberg

Walk down to the Grund in the morning. Half-timbered houses and riverside paths line this quieter district. Visit Neumünster Abbey, now a cultural center. Have coffee at a terrace by the water.

In the afternoon, take the tram to Kirchberg. Glass towers house EU institutions, and the Mudam modern art museum sits beside Fort Thüngen. This contrast shows old fortress walls against new architecture.

Spend your last evening with views from the Corniche, often called the “most beautiful balcony in Europe.” Watch the light fade over the valleys before heading to dinner.
