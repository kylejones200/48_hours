Frankfurt mixes old Germany with a skyline of glass towers. The city moves on finance, trade fairs, and Apfelwein. Two days give enough time to see medieval squares, museums on the river, and the markets that locals love.

## Where to Stay

Villa Rothschild sits outside the city in the Taunus hills. It is quiet, elegant, and set in nature. The retreat pairs well with days spent in Frankfurt. A car or train gets you downtown in half an hour. You can enjoy the city by day and return to calm at night.

## Day 1: Old Town and Apfelwein

Start in Römerberg, the main square with half-timbered houses rebuilt after the war. Step into the Römer, Frankfurt’s old town hall. Cross to the Dom, where emperors were crowned. Walk the pedestrian Zeil for shopping and street food.

Lunch at Kleinmarkthalle, the indoor market where butchers, bakers, and wine sellers fill the hall with food. Try a sausage or sample cheese.

In the afternoon, take the tram across the river to Sachsenhausen. The neighborhood is known for apple wine taverns. Sit in a wood-paneled room and order Apfelwein with schnitzel or green herb sauce.

## Day 2: Museums and Skyline Views

Begin with the Museumsufer, the row of museums along the Main. The Städel has Rembrandt and Picasso. The Deutsches Filmmuseum covers cinema history. Choose one or two depending on your pace.

Eat lunch along the river, where cafés open to the water. Then head to the Main Tower. The viewing deck gives the best skyline view in the city, looking out to the Taunus hills where your villa sits.

Spend the late afternoon in Palmengarten, Frankfurt’s large botanical garden. Paths lead through hothouses, roses, and ponds. It is a calm way to close your trip.

## Conclusion

Frankfurt offers a balance of business energy and local tradition. Staying at Villa Rothschild gives you both the city’s pace and the quiet of the countryside. In two days you see history, art, and life along the Main, with evenings reserved for the calm of the hills.
