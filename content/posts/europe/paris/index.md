Paris sets the standard for beauty, food, and style. A short stay gives a taste of cafés, museums, and the city’s streets that feel like an open-air gallery. Two days let you walk along the Seine, climb the Eiffel Tower, and sit at a café terrace watching the city pass.

## Where to Stay

Stay central. The Marais offers charm with narrow streets and boutique hotels. Saint-Germain keeps you close to the Seine and classic cafés. Near the Louvre you’ll be in the middle of landmarks and the river.

## Day 1: Icons and Cafés

Start with the Eiffel Tower. Go early to avoid long lines, or climb partway for the view and the experience. Walk to the Champ de Mars and along the Seine. Cross to Trocadéro for the famous photo view.

Spend your afternoon at the Louvre. Even a few hours gives a sense of its scale and highlights like the Mona Lisa and Winged Victory. Take a break in the courtyard or the nearby Tuileries Garden.

Dinner belongs in Saint-Germain. Sit in a café like Les Deux Magots or Café de Flore and order wine, steak frites, and dessert. Stroll past the bookshops and river before heading back.

## Day 2: Montmartre and the Seine

Begin in Montmartre at Sacré-Cœur. Climb the steps for a wide view over Paris. Wander the narrow lanes, see street artists at Place du Tertre, and have coffee in a corner café.

Come down to the Seine for a museum afternoon. Choose the Musée d’Orsay for Impressionists or Centre Pompidou for modern art. Both give a rich view of Parisian culture.

At night, take a boat ride on the Seine. The bridges light up, Notre-Dame stands tall, and the city glows. End with dinner near the Latin Quarter, where the streets stay busy late into the night.

## Conclusion

Two days in Paris give you the highlights: monuments, museums, and street life. You leave knowing the city’s rhythm, with enough memories to draw you back.
