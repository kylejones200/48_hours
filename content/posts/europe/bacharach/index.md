Bacharach sits on a sharp bend of the Rhine, framed by vineyards and medieval towers. The town feels frozen in time, with half-timbered houses, a ruined castle, and cobbled streets that look unchanged for centuries. Two days here give you river views, wine, and a slower rhythm.

## Where to Stay

The castle above town, Burg Stahleck, now runs as a hostel with sweeping views of the Rhine. In the valley, family-run inns like Hotel Kranenturm or Altkölnischer Hof keep you close to the town square. Both options give you the sense of living inside the history.


## Day 1: Old Town and Vineyards

Start in the Marktplatz, where pastel-painted houses lean toward each other. Walk to St. Peter’s Church, then climb through vineyard paths for a view back down into town. Stop for lunch at a local Weinstube for Riesling and flammkuchen.

Spend the afternoon along the Rhine promenade. Ferries come and go, and you see barges carrying goods upriver. Visit Wernerkapelle, the skeletal remains of a Gothic church that survived fire and war.

In the evening, sit outside at a tavern in the Marktplatz and order local wine. The square glows warm at night.



## Day 2: Castles and the Rhine

Walk up to Burg Stahleck in the morning. The climb is steep, but the view is wide, with the Rhine cutting through hills lined with vineyards and castles.

After breakfast, take a short boat ride on the Rhine to see Pfalzgrafenstein Castle, the white fortress that rises from an island mid-river. Return by lunch and try river fish or sausages in town.

Spend the afternoon wandering the city walls. Old towers like the Postenturm give you high vantage points and a reminder of Bacharach’s medieval defenses.

End the trip with a late dinner at a traditional Gasthaus, then stroll once more through the narrow lanes before heading on.
