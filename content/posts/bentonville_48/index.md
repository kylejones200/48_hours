## Where to Stay

Skip the chain hotels and book an **Airbnb** downtown. Bentonville’s neighborhoods hold craftsman houses, modern lofts, and guest cottages. Staying local fits the pace of the town—you wake up near the square, walk to coffee, and reach Crystal Bridges in minutes.

## Day 1: Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art

Morning belongs to **Crystal Bridges**. The museum sits in a ravine, its curved glass and wood bridges spanning ponds and forest. Inside, American works run from colonial portraits to Andy Warhol. The **James Turrell skyspace** changes your sense of light; the ceiling opens to the sky, and LED panels shift color as the sun moves.

Step outside to the **sculpture trails**. Outdoor exhibits wind through Ozark woods, with large-scale works tucked between trees and fields. Many visitors find this the best part—the art blends with nature, and the walk feels unhurried.

Dinner can circle back downtown. Bentonville Square fills with restaurants, patios, and breweries, all within a short walk of your Airbnb.

## Day 2: Native American History and Rogers

Start at the **Museum of Native American History**. Exhibits trace 14,000 years of culture, from arrowheads and pottery to headdresses and beadwork. The layout is chronological, and the audio tours make it easy to follow. The collection is broad and grounded in stories of survival and identity.

In the afternoon, take the short drive to **Rogers**. The town holds the **Daisy Airgun Museum**, a storefront dedicated to the BB gun. Inside are displays of vintage models, advertising posters, and cultural references from the Red Ryder era. It’s quirky, focused, and fun—a quick stop that contrasts with Bentonville’s high art.

Return for dinner downtown or a quiet evening in your Airbnb.

## Why 48 Hours Works

Bentonville gives you world-class art in the woods, Native American history in a focused museum, and small-town culture just down the road. Outdoor trails, a Turrell skyspace, and even a BB gun collection fit into one weekend. Two days leave you with a mix of art, history, and Americana you don’t expect in the Ozarks.
