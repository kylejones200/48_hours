Houston is big. Museums cluster in one district, barbecue lines form across the city, and space history lives at NASA. In two days you can walk through art tunnels, stand among butterflies, and eat smoked brisket that rivals anywhere in Texas.

## Day 1: Museums and Barbecue

**Children’s Museum**
Start the morning at the **Children’s Museum of Houston**. Interactive exhibits let kids build, climb, and play through science and engineering challenges. The space is colorful, noisy, and made for families to spend hours.

**Houston Zoo**
Next, walk through **Hermann Park** to the **Houston Zoo**. Elephants, big cats, and a strong primate exhibit make it one of the country’s leading zoos. Trails wind through shaded groves, keeping the walk comfortable even in summer heat.

**Museum of Fine Arts**
The **Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (MFAH)** holds a global collection across centuries. A highlight is the **James Turrell light tunnels** connecting buildings underground. Colors shift as you walk, turning a hallway into a work of art.

**Lunch – Asian Fried Chicken**
Near the museum district, you can find **Korean fried chicken spots** and pan-Asian cafés. Crispy, double-fried chicken with sticky sauces makes a quick break between museums.

**Houston Museum of Natural Science**
Spend the afternoon here. The **Cockrell Butterfly Center** is a glass dome filled with tropical plants and thousands of butterflies. The **Fabergé exhibit** shows ornate jeweled eggs and treasures of Russian royalty. Dinosaur halls and gems and minerals make this museum one of the city’s strongest.

**Dinner – BBQ Run 1**
For dinner, pick one of Houston’s top barbecue spots: **Killen’s Barbecue** in Pearland, **Pinkerton’s Barbecue** near the Heights, **CorkScrew BBQ** in Spring, or **Tejas Chocolate + Barbecue** in Tomball. Each serves brisket, ribs, and sausage with lines out the door. The choice depends on where you want to explore.

## Day 2: History, Homes, and NASA

**Bayou Bend Collection and Gardens**
Morning belongs to **Bayou Bend**, the former home of philanthropist Ima Hogg. The mansion now serves as a decorative arts museum, showing American furniture, paintings, and silver from the colonial era through the 19th century. The gardens spread across 14 acres along the bayou, shaded and quiet.

**Lunch – BBQ Run 2**
Choose another barbecue stop. If you started with Killen’s, try Tejas. If you had Pinkerton’s, try CorkScrew. Houston’s size means you can eat barbecue every day and still not repeat the same style.

**NASA Johnson Space Center**
Spend the afternoon at **NASA’s Johnson Space Center**. Tram tours take you past mission control and astronaut training facilities. The Saturn V rocket on display dwarfs visitors, stretching longer than a football field. Interactive exhibits show both the history of Apollo missions and future plans for Mars. It’s part museum, part working space complex.

**Dinner – BBQ Run 3 (Optional)**
If you want to close with one last round, grab dinner at a third barbecue spot. Each has its loyalists, and comparing brisket or sausage links becomes its own adventure.

## Why 48 Hours Works

Houston’s museum district alone fills a day, from children’s science labs to butterflies and Fabergé eggs. Bayou Bend adds history, while NASA shows the city’s reach to space. Meals are simple: line up for barbecue or sit down for fried chicken near the museums. Two days in Houston cover art, science, history, and smoke rising from brisket pits.


## Space City
**Space Center Houston**
This is the official visitor center for NASA’s Johnson Space Center. The exhibits cover Apollo, the shuttle, and the Artemis program. Don’t miss the tram tour out to historic Mission Control. It’s as close as you’ll get to America’s spacefaring heart.
