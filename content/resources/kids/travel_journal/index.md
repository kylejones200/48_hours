Travel is more than seeing new places. It helps you notice, compare, and reflect. Writing about your trip makes the memories stronger and helps you see how the journey has changed you. Use this guide before, during, and after your trip.



## Pre-Tour Journal Entry

Complete this before leaving home.

* What city are you most excited about? Why?
* What are you nervous about?
* What do you think you will see in the cities (not specific itinerary items)?
* How do you think the culture will be different?
* Any other reflections or expectations you would like to write about?



## Daily Journal Prompts

Each day, write at least 300 words. You may draw or add photos. Use the prompts that help you the most, or create your own.

**Daily Activities**
Write about what you did, where you went, and who you met.

**Observations**
What did you notice about landscapes, buildings, and city life?

**Food and Drink**
Describe meals and snacks. What was new? What was your favorite?

**Thoughts and Feelings**
How did the day make you feel? Did anything surprise or challenge you?

**Cultural Insights**
What did you learn about local traditions, customs, or ways of life?

**People You Meet**
Write about locals, guides, or fellow travelers. What conversations or interactions stood out?

**Sights, Sounds, and Smells**
Use your senses. What colors, noises, or scents describe the place best?

**Memorable Moments**
Note a moment you will always remember. Why did it stand out?

**Challenges and Triumphs**
What was hard today? How did you overcome it? What are you proud of?

**Travel Tips**
What would you tell a friend who is planning to visit the same place?

**Accommodations**
What was interesting about where you stayed?

**Budget and Expenses**
Did you spend money on something fun? Was it worth it?

**Overall Impressions**
What did you like, dislike, or find surprising about the day?



## Post-Tour Journal Entry

Complete this on the plane ride home.

* What city did you enjoy the most? Why?
* What was the craziest thing you saw? What city was it in?
* How was the culture different from Oklahoma City?
* What surprised you the most?
* What was your favorite thing that we did on tour?
* Any other reflections you would like to add?



## Why This Matters

By reflecting every day, you build a record of your trip that is richer than photos alone. You learn to notice details, compare cultures, and remember how travel makes you feel. Later, you can read back and see how the journey shaped you.
