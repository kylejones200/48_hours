Welcome to **48 Hours**, a collection of city guides designed for travelers who want to see more in less time. Each guide shows how to spend two days in a city—where to stay, what to eat, what to see, and why the trip works.  

I write these guides from the ground. I stay in the hotels, eat in the restaurants, and visit the museums. The result is direct, practical advice.  

This site is more than stories. It is a business built for travelers, tourism boards, and partners. Readers use these guides to book trips, plan weekends, and discover places worth their time.
