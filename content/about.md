This site is built for travelers who want to see more in less time. Every guide answers one question: what can you do in 48 hours that leaves you with the real spirit of a place?  

I visit the cities, stay in the hotels, eat the food, and walk the streets. Then I write short, practical guides. Each one shows where to stay, what to do on day one and day two, and why the trip works.  

It is a business. I work with tourism boards, hotels, restaurants, and attractions to create clear itineraries that reach an active audience of travelers. My readers use these guides to plan real trips, book real rooms, and buy real tickets.  Articles may include affiliate links where I earn a small commission. But all the opinions are mine. 

If you represent a destination, hotel, or attraction and want to be featured, get in touch through the **Work With Me** page. If you are a reader, sign up for the newsletter. New guides appear every week.  

Travel should be simple. My goal is to make planning fast, the days full, and the memories strong.
