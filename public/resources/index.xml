      <description>Traveling with kids means keeping track of many little essentials. A forgotten pair of shoes or stuffed animal can throw off the trip. This printable checklist makes it simple to stay organized. Each child has their own column, so you can pack with confidence and check off items as you go. Print it, stick it on a clipboard, or keep it on your phone—the goal is fewer last-minute scrambles and more time enjoying the journey.</description>
